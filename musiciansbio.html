<p>The first musician I want to talk about is Michael Jackson. He was known as the king of pop and was known to everyone due to his legendary music and dance moves. Jackson was and still is universally beloved by everyone and his music still leaves an impact in modern times more than a decade following his passing.</p>

<p>The second musician is Prince, his full name being Prince Rogers Nelson. He was one of the most influencial musician of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant and androgynous persona, a wide vocal range as well as being a multi-instrumentalist which alone is impressive in its own right. He was never confined to one style of music and was able to branch out to many different styles making him incredibly verstatile in all things music.</p>

<p>The last musician is Whitney Houston. Houston was an American singer and one of the most awarded performers of all time. She was often referred to as the "voice" her chart achievements and music videos influenced the breaking down of gender and racial barriers and is widely regarded as one of the greatest singers of all time. </p>
